                    Question 1: The student correctly provided the output of the given code snippet, so they get 2 points. \n\n
                    Question 2: The student correctly stated the difference between for loop and while loop and provided appropriate examples. Thus, they get 2 points. \n\n
                    Question 3: The student provided the correct output of the given code snippet, so they get 2 points. \n\n
                    Question 4: The student attempted to write the code using a while loop, but there were some syntax errors. The correct code should be: \n\n```\nx = 1\nwhile x <= 10:\n    if x % 2 == 0:\n        print(x)\n    x += 1\n```\nSince the student demonstrated an attempt, they get 1 point out of 2 for this question. \n\n
                    Question 5: The student correctly provided the output of the given code snippet, so they get 2 points. \n\n
                    Total score: 9 out of 10 points. \n\n
                    Comments to the student: Great job on answering most of the questions correctly. However, be careful about syntax and indentation in question 4. Keep up the good work!"
