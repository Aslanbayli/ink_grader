                    Question 1: (2 points) - The student answered this correctly and received full points.\n\n
                    Question 2: (0 points) - The student incorrectly stated the uses of while and for loops. While their statement about for loops and pre-determined iterations is correct, their statement about while loops and unknown iterations is not entirely accurate. While loops are used when the loop condition is uncertain or unknown, not necessarily the number of iterations. Additionally, the student did not provide a complete example of when to use one loop over the other, as required by the question.\n\n
                    Question 3: (2 points) - The student also answered this question correctly and received full points.\n\n
                    Question 4: (2 points) - The student provided a correct code snippet that uses a while loop to print all the even numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive).\n\n
                    Question 5: (2 points) - The student correctly identified that the output would be "apple."\n\n
                    Total score: 6 out of 10 points\n\n
                    Comments: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts covered in the quiz, but made an error in answering question 2. They also provided a messy answer for question 4, which may have been impacted by the lack of formatting in the question prompt. Moving forward, I would suggest that the student pay closer attention to the question requirements and provide clear and organized responses.'
